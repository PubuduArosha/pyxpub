# Pyxpyb - Private Payment Gateway

Pyxpub is a simple self-hosted webapp that generates unique payment requests for Bitcoin Cash. It can do this as a simple webpage with a Bitcoin Cash address and corresponding QR code or as a JSON request. It can be accessed directly, be embedded in a webpage through an iframe, or you can do JSON requests through the API. All generated Bitcoin Cash addresses are derived from a pre-defined (Electron Cash) xpub key.
